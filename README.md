# Java-Projects

Introduction
“Our world, moved by Java”, Take a moment to contemplate this phrase. Java is one of the most commonly used programming languages. It is also used as the server-side language for most of the back-end development tasks, like those concerning Android development and Big Data. Java is also used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing. The popularity of Java is further evidenced by 90 per cent of all Fortune 500 companies using Java. In this article, we’ll be looking at 15+ exciting Java project ideas/topics for you to explore and practice.

Why These Projects?
Any layman can be a good developer, no matter if you possess a certain gene code to accomplish this or not. That being said, putting in the effort and harbouring the correct mindset is inevitable to accomplish this. Creating Java projects will assist you to hone your skills on real-life projects and amplify your spirit as a developer. This is the sole way to know if you own a pragmatic grasp of the theory you’ve learned. Functioning on these Java projects will let you equip yourself for a job.

The theoretical knowledge that you have is not of utmost importance, employers are interested in how you are able to translate the knowledge in a practical setup. You should create a portfolio of the tasks you have accomplished so far. So, when you interview for the role of developer, you will have solutions, code, apps, and projects, to exhibit to the recruiters.
The portfolio will emphasize your strong points and recognize flaws that need modification.

Reasons why software companies choose Java for developing enterprise applications:

The software industry adopted Java as it made development a pleasure, resolved problems with distribution, and lessened the pang of continuously porting across platforms.
As Java is an object-oriented language, it is huge and secure. Java programs are composed independently of the platform in bytecode language, which lets the same program work on any machine that is equipped with JVM. It is a realistic and practical approach to software design. Java objects envelop data and behaviour so that code can be used again, thereby making the process of testing and troubleshooting easier.
Java’s popularity grew when people learned how Java could solve their hardships on servers – making productivity, execution, and scalability reach new levels.
Java has demonstrated its supremacy over other languages from server-side scaling of multi-tier architecture to internet distribution of software, to the cloud-native deployments, to taking benefit of continuously upgrading hardware architectures and a whole lot more.
